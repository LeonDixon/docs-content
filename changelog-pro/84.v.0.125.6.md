### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixes issue where schema sections in Pro inputs with existing `meta` keys were not being assigned programmatic `meta` values. This was preventing the `eachSection` helper function from being able access some sections — which in turn was preventing the AutoAnimate plugin from being able to be applied to repeater items. Whew... this one was a doozy. 😅

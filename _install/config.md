## Configuration

To configure FormKit, create a FormKit config file in the root of your project and import it into your Vue App.

If you would like to supply your own configuration, you can either extend `defaultConfig` by passing a [configuration object](/essentials/configuration#what-is-defaultconfig) to it, or replace with your own configuration object, which allows for improved tree-shaking (only include the rules and languages you need) and more fine-grained control:

::Callout

type: "info"
label: "Hierarchical configuration"

FormKit uses a unique hierarchical configuration system that is well suited for forms. Any global configuration defined here can be overridden for a single input, a group of inputs, or a form.

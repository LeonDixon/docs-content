### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

- The `autocomplete` and `dropdown` now have a new section called `selectionWrapper` that is used to wrap the selected option. This makes overriding the selection slot easier since you longer need to reimplement any functionality. However, this does mean there is one more dom element in the markup.
- On the `autocomplete` input when in single select mode the `removeSelection` section is now adjacent to the selection slot instead of inside of it. This makes it easier to override the selection slot without having to reimplement the remove selection functionality.

### üí™ New Features

- Dedicated FormKit Pro changelog for tracking changes separately from the open-source FormKit project. Updates to Pro will no longer be comingled with the standard FormKit changelog.
- The `datepicker` input now includes a new `clearable` prop which adds a clear button next to the input when the input has a value.

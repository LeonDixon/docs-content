## Basic example

The `currency` input allows for restricted input of values based on the provided currency and locale.

---
name: "Currency input defaults"
file: "_content/_examples/currency/currency-default.vue"

## Props

### Currency

The `currency` prop is the three letter currency code and sets the proper formatting for the specified currency. For a full list of supported currency types check: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#List_of_ISO_4217_currency_codes

### Locale

By default, the locale used will be that of what is set in your `formkit.config.ts`. This can be overriden with the `display-locale` prop. For example, `en`, `de`, `en-IN`, `zh-CN`, etc, etc.


::Example
---
name: "Currency and Locale settings"
file: "_content/_examples/currency/currency-simple-locale.vue"

## Currency Additional Props

### Decimals

If you would like to prevent decimals from being displayed, set `decimals` to `false` or `0`.

You can also choose to set a minimum number of decimals with the `min-decimals` prop. For example, setting the prop `min-decimals="2"` will always show 2 decimal points.

### Minimum and Maximum Values

Setting the props `min` or `max` will prevent entry of a higher or lower value.

### Step

Value scan be incremented and decremented by use of the up/down keys. The degree by which the value changes is determined by the `step` prop.

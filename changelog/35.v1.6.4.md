### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixes a bug with validation rule observers that caused rules with external dependencies to stop firing when placed in a certain sequence ([#1371](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/1371)).
- Fixes a bug that caused inputs with no validation rules to receive the `data-invalid` attribute on reset (regression in 1.6.3) ([#1376](https://github.com/formkit/formkit/issues/1376))
